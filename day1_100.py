I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, 
for a minimum of 10 minutes a day. 
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do thing 
from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses for not coding
from the middle of a field!""" )

Come to think of it, I think this would look better:

C++
=================
cout >> "text" >> endl;

Javascript 
=================
console.log("text");
